Hello, my name is Yaya Dembélé. Many of you already know me.
I’m also a Teacher Assistant, along with Kouba and Ali.
Over the next two months, we’ll be working together through all the lectures and materials.
Feel free to reach out to me if you need any information or assistance.

And don’t forget — we expect from you strong motivation, endurance, and courage in order to achieve the goals.
